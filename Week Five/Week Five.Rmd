# Open Science

* A survey in 2015 estimated the % of published papers in STEM subjects that included accompanying raw data

--

* Only 13% of research articles included raw data

.footnote[[Refs] 10.1371/journal.pone.0143460]

---

# "Reasons" not to share

* Fear of being "scooped"

* Patent applications

* Confidentiality - unclear about data protection

* Lack of technical ability

---

# The Reproducibility crisis in Science

* In a 2011 study it was reported that only 25% of cancer research studies could be replicated or reproduced

* Inappropriate practices of science include:

  * HARKing
  * P-hacking
  * Selective reporting
  * Poor research design
  * Publication bias


.footnote[[Refs]10.1038/nrd3439-c1]
---

# HARKing

HARKing (**H**ypothesizing **A**fter the **R**esults are **K**nown)

* Dismissing or neglecting to report on rejected *apriori* hypotheses

* Generating *new* hypotheses after collecting and analyzing data

.pull-left[

Can increase **Type 1 errors**

]

.pull-right[

Motivated by difficulty in publishing *null* results

# Confirmatory vs. Exploratory Science

Exploratory analysis is not the problem!

```

.footnote[[Refs]10.1186/s13059-020-02133-w]

---

# P-hacking

Performing many statistical tests on the data and only reporting those that come back with significant results

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="90%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/jeb_1291_f1.png")
```


.footnote[[Refs]10.1111/j.1420-9101.2006.01291.x]

# P-hacking

Widespread - but probably not but weak compared to the effect sizes being measured?

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="70%"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/p-value-bins.png")
```

.footnote[[Refs]10.1371/journal.pbio.1002106]
---

# Publication bias

* Significant results are more associate with *top* journals

* Novelty is prized

* Employers and funders count papers (weighted by journal impact) to assess performance

---
# Mistakes vs. Fraud

* How prevalent is scientific misconduct?
      * 2% of scientists admit to having fabricated, falsified, or modified data at least once 
      * Serial offenders thought to be primary drivers

* How can we prevent it & catch genuine mistakes or errors?

# What can we do?

* Collaborative data analysis

* Share data *and* analyses

* Must be understandable

---

# Version control

.pull-left[

If you use Office 365 or Google Docs, you are already using version control

# GitHub

* Git a free and open-source version control system

* GitHub a hosting system for Git that we can easily interact with using R and RStudio

* Set up a connection and your RStudio project can be Pushed to a repository on GitHub

* Fully collaborative, open, reproducible analyses

* Can be *archived* when ready to publish with a doi

# Repositories

.pull-left[
## Specialist

* Genbank

* SRA

* UniProtKB

* The Cancer Imaging Archive

.pull-right[

## General

* Figshare

* Zenodo

* Dryad

# Code readability

* What are some ways we can make our code readable?

--

* Frequent comments

* Pipes

* Use objects that make sense/relevance

* Organise directories and folders

* Provide READMEs
