# Data is big business

* Fitbit

* Amazon

* Aviva

* Open Health Foundation

* Local/National COVID strategies

---


# What can Data do?

* Increase Revenues

* Open new markets

* Improve efficiencies

* Provide insights

* Make predictions

---



# Become a better scientist

* A better platfom to generate and test hypotheses

* Produce better data visuals

* Gain the statistical tools to describe and predict from data

* Understand the importance of "open" and "reproducible" research

---


# Our process

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.alt= "Venn diagram of subject expertise, programming, maths & statistics"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tidy.png")
```

* We will use the programming language R - it is fun, flexible and will empower you to be a better Scientist.

# Questions

The starting point of gaining insights should always be the Question, not the Data

* Is there a pattern/relationship that matches our expectations?

* Can we ascribe causation?

* Can we make predictions?

---


class: center, middle, inverse

# Hypothesis

# Turn a question into a hypothesis

---

# Where does data come from?

* Controlled experiments

* 'Field' experiments

* Exploratory studies

---

# Data

What is data?

* Data are records/observations/measurements

--

* Data can be quantitative
    * Values
    * Continuous
    * Integer
    * Categorical
--

* Data can be qualitative
    * Opinion polls
    * Text mining
    * Colours

# Insights from Data

* A dataset is a collection of data

* There are many ways to arrange datasets

* We aim to cut through the variation/noise to identify patterns
---

# Key features of datasets

* Observations

* Variables
    * Response
    * Predictor

* Correlations among variables/ Confounding effects

* Independence of observations

---

# Example of Insights

This is from the palmer penguins dataset curated by Dr. Allison Horst. Data were originally collected and made available by Dr. Kristen Gorman and the Palmer Station, Antarctica LTER.

**Question** What is the relationship between bill length and bill depth
